Computational Thinking: Thinking like a computer to solve problems.

Example: Teaching a robot to make a Peanut Butter + Jelly Sandwich. What steps are needed?

Computers can't read between lines as effectively as human beings can, so they're less powerful in that regard. It's less "spread jam on bread, then peanut butter", it's a lot more nuanced than that. The instructions would have to start from "open bag of bread" and include instructions as specific as "Stick knife in jam, then spread on bread."
